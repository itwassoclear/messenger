## What is this?

Messenger project. Now it's only layout from [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/gsvfLgmxRtYrGRpZFuhWJF/Chat?node-id=0%3A1).
UI is inspired by the font [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/).

sprint 1: added layout with Handlebars

sprint 2: added simple routing and form validation. created reusable components

sprint 3: added API for authorization, registration and user settings. Websockets for chats and messages, store to update components

sprint 4: using Mocha and Chai added tests for component, router and request sending module. used Docker and Render.com for deploy the app
